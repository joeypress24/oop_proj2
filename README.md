# oop_proj2
Second project of my Object Oriented Programming class, created a cryptographic vault

The conceptual setup of this project was real world, although the cryptographic algorithms are rudimentary and not actually used. 

Algorithms were implemented for hashing, authentication, and adding users. Functions used were caesar, shift, and vigenere.
